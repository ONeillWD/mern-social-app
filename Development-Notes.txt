This is my personal log as I work through the code to track bugs and issues
****----*

The code on the bottom of page 221 breaks the code and does not enable a bio to be added to the profile. 

Page 227 has you edit the use.controller update and the code is completely different with portions in the try statment 

Statements that the book want you to add will be bold but then the rest of the code that they changed will not be bolded pg 227

When importing the profile picture the book does not mention adding the file before and this stops the project from working 

Pg 233 project is not running at all due to some problem with the node modules.

Confusion from where I am supposed to place some of the lines of code pg233

How am I supposed to know when to import the packages with react 

p238 book does not show any onf the packages that you import. how am I supposed to know when to import these different packages.


End Notes:

Comments.js:
Book never showed import files and never gave us instructions to set the use styles

NewPost.js:
Book did not show import of 16 files or the usesStyle settings. I have 27 lines of code when the end file has 136***

NewFeed.js
I have 50 lines and the book file has 75
